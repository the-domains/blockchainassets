  A blockchain is a public ledger of all Bitcoin transactions that have ever
  been executed. It is constantly growing as ‘completed’ blocks are added to it
  with a new set of recordings. The blocks are added to the blockchain in a
  linear, chronological order. Each node (computer connected to the Bitcoin
  network using a client that performs the task of validating and relaying
  transactions) gets a copy of the blockchain, which gets downloaded
  automatically upon joining the Bitcoin network. The blockchain has complete
  information about the addresses and their balances right from the genesis
  block to the most recently completed block.

A blockchain is a public ledger of all [Bitcoin][0] transactions that have ever been executed. It is constantly growing as 'completed' [blocks][1] are added to it with a new set of recordings. The blocks are added to the blockchain in a linear, chronological order. Each node (computer connected to the Bitcoin network using a client that performs the task of validating and relaying transactions) gets a copy of the blockchain, which gets downloaded automatically upon joining the Bitcoin network. The blockchain has complete information about the addresses and their balances right from the genesis block to the most recently completed block.
