## What is a 'Blockchain'

A blockchain is a public ledger of all[Bitcoin][0]transactions that have ever been executed. It is constantly growing as 'completed'[blocks][1]are added to it with a new set of recordings. The blocks are added to the blockchain in a linear, chronological order. Each node (computer connected to the Bitcoin network using a client that performs the task of validating and relaying transactions) gets a copy of the blockchain, which gets downloaded automatically upon joining the Bitcoin network. The blockchain has complete information about the addresses and their balances right from the genesis block to the most recently completed block.
